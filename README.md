### Healthcare IT champion.

If you get a laboratory test done in Te Manawa Taki (Midland Region, New Zealand), you're using my code!

- IT implementation lead of a full immunology analyser refresh.
- Interfaced world's first BD Cor on the Synapsys platform.
- In place platform migration of full microbiology automation suite.
- Sole developer of [Pathlab's website](https://www.pathlab.co.nz/).
- Real time registration data insights, courier tracking, cross department messaging.
- Health and business statistical insights, quality incident investigation, novel health data requests.

Outside of work, I'm a business and finance nerd, enthralled by D&D, and all about nature relatedness.

Most of what I do is sensitive/proprietary/legacy. But you might catch me here tinkering with web dev, automation, data analysis, or cloud stuff.
